# Seungheon Lee

### Professional Experience

I recently completed an internship as a Software Engineer at the [S/W Innovation Center](https://research.samsung.com/software-engineering) of [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/). During my time there, I built and deployed a monitoring system for LLM inference servers in a Kubernetes environment. This project was developed and implemented in the staging environment, making it ready for final testing before production release.

### Academic Background

Prior to my internship, I was an undergraduate researcher at the [Robotics Lab](https://robotics.uos.ac.kr/) of the [University of Seoul](https://english.uos.ac.kr/). Throughout my academic journey, I maintained a major GPA of 4.35/4.5, which allowed me to engage in various research opportunities and competitions:

- I authored three undergraduate research papers, contributing to the field of robotics and AI.

- I participated in and won awards in notable competitions:
  - [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/): 1st place in the [ARM Challenge](https://arm.robocup.org/)
  - Autonomous Robot Racing: Grand Prize and multiple Safety Driving Awards

These experiences not only honed my technical skills and resulted in several awards, but also developed my ability to conduct research and present findings effectively.

### Projects

Throughout my academic career, I've worked on numerous AI-focused projects, including:

1. [Adaptive LAD for Pure-pursuit using Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Githarold/AdaptiveLAD-PurePursuitRL)
2. [AI-powered Smart Bartending System](https://github.com/Githarold/BartendAiRtist)
3. [Automated Diet Management App](https://github.com/Githarold/NutriScan)

These projects have helped me apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios.

### Skills

- Kubernetes
- LLM (Large Language Models)
- Robotics
- AI and Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Hobbies

When I'm not coding or working on projects, you can find me:

- Playing League of Legends
- Cycling around the city
- Watching movies

I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and these activities help me recharge and stay creative.
