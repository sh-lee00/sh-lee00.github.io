# Seungheon Lee

### Professional Experience

I recently completed an internship as a Software Engineer at the [S/W Innovation Center](https://research.samsung.com/software-engineering) of [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/). During my time there, I built and deployed a monitoring system for LLM inference servers in a Kubernetes environment. This project was developed and implemented in the staging environment, making it ready for final testing before production release.

### Academic Background

Prior to my internship, I was an undergraduate researcher at the [Robotics Lab](https://robotics.uos.ac.kr/) of the [University of Seoul](https://english.uos.ac.kr/). Throughout my academic journey, I've maintained the top academic performance in my department, ranking 1st out of 46 students with a major GPA of 4.35/4.5. This academic excellence has opened doors to various research opportunities and competitions:

- I authored three undergraduate research papers, contributing to the field of robotics and AI.

- I participated in and won awards in notable competitions:
  - [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/): 1st place in the [ARM Challenge](https://arm.robocup.org/)
  - Autonomous Robot Racing: Grand Prize and multiple Safety Driving Awards

These experiences not only honed my technical skills and resulted in several awards, but also developed my ability to conduct research and present findings effectively.

### Projects

I've worked on various AI-focused projects, including:

1. Computer Vision AI Model Optimization for NPU-based Inference (Ongoing until December 2024)
   - Participating in the [1st AI Semiconductor Technology Talent Selection Competition](https://www.aichipcon.or.kr/)
   - Collaborating with [Furiosa AI](https://furiosa.ai/) to develop efficient inference solutions optimized for their NPU architecture
   - Focusing on maximizing performance and efficiency of computer vision AI models

2. [Adaptive LAD for Pure-pursuit using Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Githarold/AdaptiveLAD-PurePursuitRL)

3. [AI-powered Smart Bartending System](https://github.com/Githarold/2024ESWContest_free_1078)

4. [Automated Diet Management App](https://github.com/Githarold/NutriScan)

These projects have helped me apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios.

### Skills

- Kubernetes
- LLM (Large Language Models)
- Robotics
- AI and Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Computer Vision
- AI Model Optimization

### Hobbies

When I'm not coding or working on projects, you can find me:

- Building a trading bot for quantitative investing
- Playing League of Legends
- Cycling around the city
- Watching movies

I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and these activities help me recharge and stay creative.
