# Seungheon Lee

## Professional Experience

I recently completed an internship as a Software Engineer at the [S/W Innovation Center](https://research.samsung.com/software-engineering) of [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/). During my time there, I built and deployed a monitoring system for LLM inference servers in a Kubernetes environment. This project was developed and implemented in the staging environment, making it ready for final testing before production release.

## Academic Background

Prior to my internship, I was an undergraduate researcher at the Robotics Lab of the University of Seoul. This experience allowed me to participate in various competitions, including:

- [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/)
- Autonomous Robot Racing

I'm proud to say that I've won awards in several of these competitions.

## Projects

Throughout my academic career, I've worked on numerous AI-focused projects, including:

1. [Adaptive LAD for Pure-pursuit using Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Githarold/AdaptiveLAD-PurePursuitRL)
2. [AI-powered Smart Bartending System](https://github.com/Githarold/BartendAiRtist)
3. [Automated Diet Management App](https://github.com/Githarold/NutriScan)

These projects have helped me apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios.

## Skills

- Kubernetes
- LLM (Large Language Models)
- Robotics
- AI and Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## Hobbies

When I'm not coding or working on projects, you can find me:

- Playing League of Legends
- Cycling around the city
- Watching movies

I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and these activities help me recharge and stay creative.
